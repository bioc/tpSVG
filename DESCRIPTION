Description: The goal of `tpSVG` is to detect and visualize spatial variation in
  the gene expression for spatially resolved transcriptomics data analysis.
  Specifically, `tpSVG` introduces a family of count-based models, with 
  generalizable parametric assumptions such as Poisson distribution or 
  negative binomial distribution. In addition, comparing to currently 
  available count-based model for spatially resolved data analysis, the 
  `tpSVG` models improves computational time, and hence greatly improves 
  the applicability of count-based models in SRT data analysis.
